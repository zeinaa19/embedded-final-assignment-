*** Test Cases ***
Test Case 1:Check the System's and the LCD Display's functionality
    [Documentation]    [Make sure the system starts up properly, reads initial values from EEPROM, and dshows them on the LCD .]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Power on the system
    connect the ADC, motor, buttons, and LCD components 
    program EEPROM with known values for the lower and upper limits (eg:0)

    [Action steps]
    Let the system start and show the starting values on the LCD.

    [Assertion steps]
    The expected outcome is that there will be a temperature reading shown on the LCD,
     "L:" and "U:" displayed the initial lower and upper limit values from EEPROM, and the LCD displayed "Nok" if temperature is outside the limits

Test Case 2: [change the Lower Limit by Pressing the Button]
    [Documentation]    [the value on the LCD will change by pressing the button assigned to raise the lower limit]
    
    [Setup steps]
     LCD shows the system's temperature
     the lower limit is initially set to 0

    [Action steps]
      Press the lower limit button repeatedly
    
    [Assertion steps]
     the LCD's lower limit will increase by 5 with every press and the temperature and upper limit display don't change


Test Case 3: [change the upper Limit by Pressing the Button]
    [Documentation]    [the value on the LCD will change by pressing the button assigned to raise the upper limit]
    
    [Setup steps]
     LCD shows the system's temperature
     the upper limit is initially set to 0

    [Action steps]
    Press the button for the upper limit repeatedly

    [Assertion steps]
    the LCD's upper limit increases by 5 with each press and the lower limit and temperature display remain unchanged


Test Case 4: [Display "OK" when temperature is Within Range]
    [Documentation]    [The current temperature is between the lower and upper limits, so the LCD dispalys "OK" and the motor turns clockwise ]
    
    [Setup steps]
    sensor reads temperature
    Set lower limit(eg:20) and upper limit(eg:30) to match the current temperature(eg:27)
    
    [Action steps]
     sensor will read the temperature and display it on the LCD

    [Assertion steps]
     LCD displays "OK" in the assigned location and the motor is turning clockwise
  

    Test Case 5: [show "Nok" when Temperature is Outside Range on the LCD]
    [Documentation]    [ LCD shows "Nok" and that the motor turns counterclockwise when the current temperature is outside the range]
    
    [Setup steps]
    sensor reads temperature
    set lower limit(eg:10) and upper limit(eg:30) far from the current temperature(eg:37)
    
    [Action steps]
    sensor will read the temperature and display it on the LCD
    
    [Assertion steps]
    LCD displays "NOK" in the assigned location and the motor is turning counterclockwise


    Test Case 6: [Reset Limits with The Reset Button]
    [Documentation]    [The reset button resets the lower and upper limits to 0 when pressed and updates the LCD]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set the lower limit to 10 and the upper limit to 30 using the upper and lower limit buttons

    [Action steps]
   Press the reset button

    [Assertion steps]
    The lower and upper limits should reset to 0 and the LCD displays "L:0" and "U:0".


    Test Case 7: [LCD Display Accuracy]
    [Documentation]    [the LCD accurately shows the temperature and the upper and lower limits]
    
    [Setup steps]
    ADC reads temperature (eg:25.7)
    Set the lower limit(eg:20) and the upper limit(eg:30) to match the current temperature.
    
    [Action steps]
     system will display the temperature and limits on the LCD

    [Assertion steps]
     the LCD accurately displays the temperature "25.7C" and "L:20" and "U:30" are displayed without errors


    Test Case 8: [Extreme Temperature Change Outside of Range]
    [documentation]    [the system can handle a temperature that is extremely outside the  range]
 
    [Setup steps]
    ADC reads temperature (eg:25)
    Set the lower limit(eg:20) and the upper limit(eg:30) to match the current temperature.

    [Action steps]
    simulate a sudden temperature change to 40C

    [Assertion steps]
    The LCD should display "Nok" and the motor should turn counterclockwise 


    Test Case 9: [Temperature at the Lower Limit exactly]
    [documentation]    [ the reaction of the system when the temperature is exactly at the lower limit]
 
    [Setup steps]
    ADC reads temperature (eg:15)
    Set lower limit to 15C and upper limit to 25C

    [Action steps]
    set lower limit to be exactly as the temeperature read

    [Assertion steps]
    The LCD should display "OK" and the motor should turn clockwise


    Test Case 10: [Temperature at the upper Limit exactly]
    [documentation]    [ the reaction of the system when the temperature is exactly at the upper limit]
 
    [Setup steps]
    ADC reads temperature (eg:30)
    Set lower limit to 15C and upper limit to 30C

    [Action steps]
    Simulate the temperature being exactly at 30C

    [Assertion steps]
    The LCD should display "NOK" and the motor should turn counterclockwise 


Test Case 11: [Functionality of the limits buttons at once]
    [documentation]    [Press on the 2 buttons responsible for the limits at the same time]
 
    [Setup steps]
    Connect the circuit components
    connect the Arduino to the pc

    [Action steps]
   press the 2 buttons(lower limit,upper limit) at once

    [Assertion steps]
    Both limits will increase (lower limit and upper limit)
