Test Case 1:Initialization of the System and the LCD Display
    [Documentation]    [Make sure the system starts up properly, reads initial values from EEPROM, and displays them on the LCD .]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Power on the system
    Ensure that ADC, motor,buttons, and LCD components are connected
    Preprogram EEPROM with known values for lower and upper limits (eg:0)

    [Action steps]
    Allow the system to initialize and display the initial values on the LCD

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify the initial temperature reading on the LCD
    Verify that "L:" and "U:" display the initial lower and upper limit values from EEPROM
    Verify the LCD displays "Nok" if temperature is outside the limits

Test Case 2: [Adjust the Lower Limit by Pressing the Button]
    [Documentation]    [Ensure that the value on the LCD is updated accurately by pressing the button designated to raise the lower limit]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Confirm that the LCD is showing the system's temperature
    Ensure the lower limit is initially set to 0

    [Action steps]
    Continuously press the the lower limit button 
    
    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD's lower limit increases by 5 with each press 
    Verify that the temperature display and higher limit don't change unexpectedly


Test Case 3: [Adjust Upper Limit with Button Press]
    [Documentation]    [ensure that the value on the LCD is updated accurately by pressing the button designated to raise the upper limit]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Confirm that the LCD is showing the system's temperature
    Set the initial upper limit to 0

    [Action steps]
    Press the button for the upper limit incrementally

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD's upper limit increases by 5 with each press 
    Confirm that the lower limit and temperature display remain unchanged


Test Case 4: [Display "OK" when Temperature is Within Range]
    [Documentation]    [Confirm that when the current temperature is between the lower and upper limits, the LCD displays "OK" and that the motor turns clockwise ]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 20 and upper limit to 30
    Set the sensor to a temperature within this range 
    
    [Action steps]
    Allow the sensor to read the temperature and display it

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD displays "OK" in the designated location
    Verify that the motor, which indicates that the temperature is within range, is activated and is turning clockwise
  

    
    Test Case 5: [Display "Nok" when Temperature is Outside Range]
    [Documentation]    [Ensure that the LCD shows "Nok" and that the motor turns anti clockwise when the current temperature is outside the designated range]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 10 and upper limit to 20
    Set the sensor to a temperature outside this range 

    [Action steps]
    Allow the sensor to read the temperature and display it
    

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that "Nok" appears on the LCD in the designated location
    Ensure that the motor is activated and is turning counterclockwise 


    Test Case 6: [Reset Limits with Reset Button]
    [Documentation]    [Verify that pressing the reset button resets both lower and upper limits to 0 and updates the LCD]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set the lower limit to 10 and the upper limit to 30 using the buttons

    [Action steps]
   Press the reset button

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that both lower and upper limits are reset to 0.
    Verify that the LCD displays "L:0" and "U:0".


    Test Case 7: [LCD Display Accuracy]
    [Documentation]    [Ensure that, the LCD accurately shows the temperature as well as both the upper and lower limits]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set the lower limit to 10 and the upper limit to 40.
    Simulate a temperature of 25.7C.
    
    [Action steps]
    Allow the system to display the temperature and limits on the LCD

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD accurately displays the temperature as "25.7C".
    Verify that "L:10" and "U:40" are displayed without truncation or formatting errors


    Test Case 8: [Extreme Temperature Change Outside of Range]
    [documentation]    [Confirm that the system correctly handles a temperature significantly outside the defined range]
 
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 15C and upper limit to 25C
    Set initial temperature within range

    [Action steps]
    simulate a sudden temperature change to 40C

    [Assertion steps]
    The LCD should display "Nok"
    The motor should turn anticlockwise 


    Test Case 9: [Lower Limit Boundary Condition]
    [documentation]    [Verify the reaction of the system when the temperature is exactly at the lower limit]
 
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 15C and upper limit to 25C

    [Action steps]
    Simulate the temperature being exactly at 15C

    [Assertion steps]
    The LCD should display "OK" (indicating within range)
    The motor should turn clockwise


    Test Case 10: [Upper Limit Boundary Condition]
    [documentation]    [Verify the reaction of the system when the temperature is exactly at the upper limit]
 
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 15C and upper limit to 25C

    [Action steps]
    Simulate the temperature being exactly at 25C

    [Assertion steps]
    The LCD should display "NOK" (indicating out of range)
    The motor should turn counterclockwise
